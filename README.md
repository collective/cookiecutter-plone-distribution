# Cookiecutter Plone Distribution

Powered by [Cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter), [Cookiecutter Plone Distribution](https://github.com/collective/cookiecutter-plone-distribution/) is intended to be used by Plone integrations willing to implement their own Plone Distributions.

A Plone distribution is a pre-packaged version of Plone that includes specific features, themes, modules, and configurations. It is a convenient way to get a specific type of website up and running quickly, as the distribution includes everything needed to run that type of site.
